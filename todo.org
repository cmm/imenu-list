* TODO add more actions
like bind the show-noselect thing to something.
also the goto-and-toggle-tree pun is kinda ugly.
* TODO crawling the buffer line-by-line sucks
should record drawn widget positions, after I figure out which widget
method to wrap for that
* fix performance
it sucks, but according to profile it's
Imenu/Eglot/over-eager-LSP-server (like Nixd with all-packages.nix)
that sucks and not us, so
