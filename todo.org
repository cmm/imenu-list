* fix source location indication
** TODO sort out the mapping in the first place
** TODO expand on demand
that is, if the index item for current source location is hidden, make
sure it is shown
* TODO fix widget keymaps
it's a wild west at present: expanders have one keymap, buttons have
another, <tab> behavior is inconsistent and useless
* TODO expand top level if only one root
or, even better, expand enough to fill the window?
* TODO add useful bindings to the index
like, xref stuff?
* TODO clicking inner items shrinks the subtree now
should be an easy fix
