* fix source location indication
** DONE sort out the mapping in the first place
** DONE expand on demand
that is, if the index item for current source location is hidden, make
sure it is shown
* DONE fix widget keymaps
it's a wild west at present: expanders have one keymap, buttons have
another, <tab> behavior is inconsistent and useless

(made tree tags normal links, seems OK now?)
* DONE expand top level if only one root
or, even better, expand enough to fill the window?
* add useful bindings to the index
like, xref stuff?  (nah)
* DONE use tree-widget directly
should be no real need for an intermediary like hierarchy.el, plus
potentially more control, plus no need to disambiguate items.
* clicking inner items shrinks the subtree now?
appears to be an org-mode thing, punting
* TODO fix performance
it sucks
